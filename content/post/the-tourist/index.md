Through a small opening in a coat

Glinted a shard of iridescent blue.

The Tourist pulled it closer, clearing her throat,

To shield from the cold wind that blew

Sounding a low, ominous whistle

As if in taunt or admiration.

The sea, from behind, offered a drizzle

Urging her to flaunt His generous creation.

The Tourist moved ahead, steadfast

Reading from a finger lined with the past.


She walked through the crowded thoroughfare

Each standing still with muffled screams

Albeit with pressed shirts and slicked back hair

Like a requiem for their forsaken dreams.

She reached into her coat and chipped off from an edge;

And offered it to each stationed sentry

Who stood there as if bound by a pledge,

As a payment for her entry.

The tourist entered the city at last

Having added to the finger lined with the past.


To her, all these cities looked the same;

Two stone walls rising on either side

And yet, deserving of all their fame

But none offering a place to hide.

As often before, she was found by a man

Offering to make her feel whole.

She placed a fading blue chip on his hand

Paying her debt with a piece of her soul.

She walked away, hoping to be alone at last

Adding again to the finger lined with her past.


One might wonder, “What use is it?”

Is the soul too much for the feet to carry?

Why lose yourself to a cause unfit?”

To you, I say, it is the contrary.

Like others, she was born set into motion.

So while the wind howled through each rift

She rolled ahead like waves of the ocean

While denying herself her own weight to lift.

And with every loss she did outlast

She added to the finger lined with her past.
