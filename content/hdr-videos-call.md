#### UPDATE: Now accepting Samsung phones in addition to iPhones, clarifying that videos must be in landscape mode, and updated duration requirements to 20 seconds from 10 seconds. Please read the text for more details.


Hello! My name is Abhinau and I am a Graduate Research Assistant at UT Austin. I am conducting a study to understand the impact of tone-mapping on the quality of High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos. Simply put, HDR videos are capable of capturing a wide range of brightness (think bright clouds and shadows at the same time) and colors, in comparison to the usual Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) videos. However, the vast majority of displays currently in use are only capable of displaying SDR content. As a result, HDR videos must be “down-converted” to SDR using a process called tone-mapping, thereby “degrading” their quality. The goal of this study is to understand and model these effects.

As part of the study, I will be creating a database of tone-mapped videos, obtained from a set of HDR video clips. It is to collect this set of HDR clips that I am reaching out to you for your help. If you own a phone capable of recording HDR video (e.g. iPhones 12 and 13, and Samsung Galaxy S10 and S10+), please consider signing up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe10jSGzzbRick_mr61cSHH6yWCsyLKvUaBoquIeNtYFG_QhQ/viewform) to record and submit any number of HDR video clips. Since each clip is expected to be around 10 seconds in length, this will likely not be a great demand on your time. Having said that, because we want to isolate the degradation in quality due to tone-mapping, please note that the video clips will need to be “pristine”, and follow certain guidelines. In any case, prior to filming, ensure that HDR video recording is turned on ([iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/iphone/iph2cafe2ebc/ios), [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00086003/)).

1. Please be sure to film either moving objects (like people walking around, trees shaking in the wind, etc.) or pan the camera slowly as you film. While it is important to avoid rapid camera movements, since they lead to motion blur, videos with almost no motion are not particularly useful since they are not very different from images. Aim to strike a balance so that the video contains motion but no motion blur.
2. Film at a resolution of 1080p (landscape mode) and the highest available frame rate. The duration of the video must be at least 20 seconds long. Filming at the highest available framerate reduces the chances of motion blur. Filming at higher resolutions than 1080p is okay, but the video will be downscaled to 1080p at our end before any processing.
3. Finally, follow these instructions to export your videos if you are using an [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211950) (using iMovie may be the easiest choice). If you are using a Samsung phone, share the video from the "My Files" app. In both cases, do not share directly from the gallery/photos app - this will not export an HDR video. Furthermore, if you are given the option, export at the highest possible quality setting - do not compress! If you are not given any option regarding quality, follow the usual steps.

In addition to being "pristine", we would like to ensure that the content of the video is such that it highlights the strengths of HDR, i.e., it exhibits a wide range of brightness (i.e., video contains both bright and dark areas) and/or is colorful. To this end, you may find the following content suggestions helpful.

1. Colorful scenes are preferred - this includes lights, trees, flowers, etc.
2. Popular choices of HDR videos include nature/sceneries such as hills, a beautiful sunrise/sunset, trees in the fall.
3. Night-time scenes with colorful lights, such as city walkthroughs are another popular choice.
4. Snow in winter would be another great choice, since snow is very bright. It is also a good opportunity to capture colorful winter clothes, winter/Christmas lights, etc.

For examples of HDR videos, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1-Jmq7BLFE) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nTO4zSEpOs); several others are available on YouTube. Note that, unlike these examples, the audio that is captured along with your videos will be completely ignored, since we are interested in purely the visual quality. Finally, should you submit one or more videos to the study, we will ask that you sign an agreement allowing us to freely distribute them to the public. So, please do not submit any private, proprietary, or confidential videos.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at abhinaukumar@utexas.edu. I hope you will spend a small amount of your time supporting this line of research. Our findings will directly help in developing the next generation of video processing tools for delivering high-quality videos, making your contributions immensely valuable!
