I am a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I work at the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering [(LIVE)](https://live.ece.utexas.edu) with [Prof. Alan Bovik](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/alan-bovik) as a Graduate Research Assistant. We use statistical, signal processing and machine learning methods to evaluate and optimize the subjective quality of images and videos. This is especially relevant in the context of the online [video explosion](https://www.ncta.com/whats-new/report-where-does-the-majority-of-internet-traffic-come) in recent years.

I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in) with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering, where I was awarded an Institute Silver Medal for having the highest score in my department. While at IIT Hyderabad, I worked with [Dr. Sumohana Channappayya](https://www.iith.ac.in/~sumohana/) on applying Deep Learning to [Fourier Ptychography](publication/fourier-ptychography). During the summer of 2018, I interned at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) as a research intern with [Prof. Katia Sycara](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/) under the [SN Bose Scholar Program](https://www.iusstf.org/program/sn-bose-scholars-program) where I worked on developing a biologically-inspired [safe Reinforcement Learning algorithm](publication/safe-reinforcement-learning). I was also a summer intern at Uurmi Systems (C/o Mathworks Inc.) where I worked on optimizing stereo matching algorithms for GPUs using CUDA.

During my junior year, I was the student head of [Sunshine, the Counseling Cell of IIT Hyderabad](https://sunshine.iith.ac.in/). Previously, during my sophomore year, I had been a student mentor at Sunshine, the coordinator of the [Quiz Club](http://gymkhana.iith.ac.in/litsoc.html), the Literary Events coordinator at [Elan, the cultural fest of IIT Hyderabad](https://www.facebook.com/pg/elan.iithyderabad/posts/) and an editor for [Lexicon, the magazine of the Literary Society](https://theiithlexicon.wordpress.com/).

When I am not trying to figure out why you didn't like that one cat video as much as the others, I play badminton for leisure and write amateur poetry.
